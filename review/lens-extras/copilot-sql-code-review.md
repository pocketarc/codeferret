Review the diff, not the repository. A scan of the whole schema spends the run's budget on
code this change did not touch, so open only the tables, indexes and migrations that a
statement in the diff depends on.

Where a statement in the diff depends on a table, an index or a migration outside it, read
that file to decide the finding, and anchor it to the line in that file, even when the diff
does not touch it. The fix for a sequential scan or a missing composite index is usually in
a migration, and an author sent to the query instead has to find that for themselves.

Where you have nothing to report, say in `notes` which surfaces you ruled out and how:
literal SQL in strings and fenced blocks, ORM and query-builder calls, migration and schema
files, stored procedures and views. A diff whose data access is all ORM holds no literal
SQL at all, so a grep for `SELECT` returning nothing is not on its own an answer.
